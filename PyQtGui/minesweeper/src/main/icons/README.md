![Sample app icon](linux/128.png)

The difference between the icons on Mac and the other platforms is that on Mac,
they contain a ~5% transparent margin. This is because otherwise they look too
big (eg. in the Dock or in the app switcher).

You can create Icon.ico from the .png files with
[an online tool](http://icoconvert.com/Multi_Image_to_one_icon/).
